Why not just library XY?
========================

Using MorphoCut for the processing of data streams offers several advantages over directly using raw image processing libraries.
Here are some reasons why MorphoCut is preferable in this context:

#. **Stream Processing:** MorphoCut is specifically designed for processing streams of data, such as consecutive images.
   It provides a framework for efficiently handling large amounts of data in a streaming fashion.
   This stream processing capability allows for seamless and continuous analysis of data without the need for storing intermediate results, reducing memory requirements, and improving overall efficiency.
#. **Modularity and Customization:** MorphoCut offers a modular approach to data processing, allowing users to build processing pipelines using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of processing nodes.
   This modularity enables easy customization and adaptability of the pipeline to specific requirements or variations in the data stream.
   Users can selectively apply and configure processing nodes from MorphoCut or other libraries to incorporate specific functionalities or algorithms needed for their image processing tasks.
#. **Fault Tolerance:** MorphoCut incorporates fault tolerance mechanisms that handle errors encountered during data processing.
   For example, when dealing with unreadable image files, MorphoCut allows to skip those files and continue processing the rest of the data stream.
   This fault tolerance feature ensures the robustness of the pipeline, minimizing disruptions, and facilitating smooth data analysis.
#. **Parallel Processing:** MorphoCut provides capabilities for parallel processing, allowing for efficient utilization of available computing resources, such as multi-core CPUs or GPUs.
   This parallelism enhances processing speed and scalability, enabling faster analysis of the data stream.
#. **Integration with Existing Libraries:** While MorphoCut is a standalone framework, it can seamlessly integrate with other popular Python libraries.
   This integration allows users to leverage the functionalities and algorithms provided by these libraries within the MorphoCut pipeline, expanding   the range of available tools for data processing and analysis.
#. **Ease of Modification and Extension:** The MorphoCut framework's structure and design make it easy to modify and extend the processing pipeline.
   Users can add or modify processing nodes, configure parameters, or incorporate new functionality as needed.
   This flexibility allows for iterative improvements and customization of the pipeline to cater to specific image processing requirements.

Overall, using MorphoCut for processing data streams provides a higher level of abstraction, streamlines the implementation of complex pipelines, offers fault tolerance, supports parallel processing, and facilitates integration with other libraries.
These advantages make MorphoCut a preferable choice for data stream processing, allowing researchers to efficiently analyze and extract meaningful insights from their continuous data streams.

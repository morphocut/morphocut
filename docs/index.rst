MorphoCut is a pipelined image processing library designed to handle
large volumes of biological, medical, oceanographic and remote sensing
image data. It is modular from ground up and comes with "`batteries
included`_" to provide common processing steps like segmentation and
feature extraction. It reads and writes many :doc:`formats <formats>`
like video,
`Bio-Formats <https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/latest/supported-formats.html>`__
and `EcoTaxa <https://ecotaxa.obs-vlfr.fr/>`__.

The MorphoCut library is accompanied by a `web
application <https://github.com/morphocut/morphocut-server>`__ that
serves as a front end to the library.

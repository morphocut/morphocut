This repository contains the MorphoCut image processing pipeline
library.

MorphoCut is a pipelined image processing library designed to handle
large volumes of biological, medical, oceanographic and remote sensing
image data. It is modular from ground up and comes with "batteries
included" to provide common processing steps like segmentation and
feature extraction. It reads and writes many
`formats <https://morphocut.readthedocs.io/en/stable/formats.html>`__
like video,
`Bio-Formats <https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/latest/supported-formats.html>`__
and `EcoTaxa <https://ecotaxa.obs-vlfr.fr/>`__.

The MorphoCut library is accompanied by a `web application`_ that
serves as a front end to the library.

For further information, have a look at the `documentation`_.
